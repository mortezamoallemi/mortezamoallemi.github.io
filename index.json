We investigate the effect that this has had on housing prices at the postcode level. The endogeneity of immigrant inflows is accounted for using the Bartik shift‐share approach. Using data from the censuses in 2006, 2011, and 2016, we find that an immigrant inflow of 1% of a postcode's population raises housing prices by around 0.9% per year. As a result, Australian housing prices would have been around 1.1% lower per annum had there been no immigration. The size of this effect is broadly consistent with that found for other countries. The effects of immigration on housing prices were larger in the more recent part of the period examined and strongest in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, and the cities of Melbourne and Adelaide. Chinese and Indian immigrant groups are shown to have a strong positive influence on prices.","tags":null,"title":"The Impact of Immigration on Housing Prices in Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Morteza Moallemi","Daniel Melser"],"categories":null,"content":"An empirical study on the economic interactions of the regional economies in Australia.\nIn Economic Record, 2019.\n","date":1551830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551830400,"objectID":"1a21f2fb37e910a8fc5bbf089c80f115","permalink":"/publication/economic_integration_gvar/","publishdate":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/economic_integration_gvar/","section":"publication","summary":"Australia's economy, like most national economies, is made up of several regional sub‐economies. How these regional economies interact is not well understood but is relevant to macroeconomic policy setting. We outline and estimate a flexible Global Vector Autoregression model using quarterly data on house prices, output, unemployment and population for the eight Australian states and territories from 1986 to 2016. Using region‐to‐region impulse response functions from this model we quantify the influence of shocks in one region on another. Our results highlight the high degree of influence of New South Wales on other regions over and above its size.","tags":null,"title":"Examining the Economic Interactions between Australia's Regions: Results from a Global VAR","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bb238c2d1697da0a6715e7e8c8299cef","permalink":"/project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts","type":"page"}]
